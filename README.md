# Module 8 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

This Project was created to practice JQuery and work with API's (moment, openweather).
Goal of this Project is to create application where we can search for weather forecast in different cities.
Search history is stored in localstorage.

And at the end we have web-application with search button and input. On button click city name is added to search history and weather forecast is displayed.
